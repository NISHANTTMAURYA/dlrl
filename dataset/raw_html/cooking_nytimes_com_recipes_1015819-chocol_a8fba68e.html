But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. (You can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work. If you’re in the market for one, our colleagues at The Wirecutter have tested quite a few, and they've put together an excellent guide to the best.)","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Leite"},"image":[{"@id":"nyt://image/221a2f19-e3c7-5ea0-bfcb-67910aba12fe#videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600","@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/12/dining/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","creditText":"Ryan Liebe for The New York Times.

Will definitely be sticking to all purpose flour from now on.","datePublished":"2017-10-24T21:19:41.000Z"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alice"},"reviewBody":"I've found it works really well rolling the dough into logs, wrapping with greaseproof paper, then cling flim, and freezing.

But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. (You can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work. If you’re in the market for one, our colleagues at The Wirecutter have tested quite a few, and they've put together an excellent guide to the best.)","hasPart":{"@type":"WebPageElement","cssSelector":".recipe","isAccessibleForFree":false},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"NYT Cooking","productID":"cooking.nytimes.com:basic"},"name":"Chocolate Chip Cookies","primaryImageOfPage":[{"@id":"nyt://image/221a2f19-e3c7-5ea0-bfcb-67910aba12fe#videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600","@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/12/dining/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","creditText":"Ryan Liebe for The New York Times.

But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. (You can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work. If you’re in the market for one, our colleagues at The Wirecutter have tested quite a few, and they've put together <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">an excellent guide to the best</a>.)<span class="pantry--ui-strong"> —David Leite</span></p></div><p class="topnote_relatedArticle__1O6C4"><span class="pantry--ui-strong">Featured in:</span> <a class="link_link__7WCQy link_default__lKxiG topnote_articleLink__2kF0V" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining/09chip.html"><span class="pantry--ui">Perfection?

class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">I think this recipe is unnecessarily fussy. The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k

several recipes, including CC cookies. Use cold butter. Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully!</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 1704</span></span></span></button></div></div></div></section><section role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="all" class="notes_isHidden__PANdr"><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Kevin C</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">6 hours ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">This is our family's favourite cookie.

But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. (You can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work. If you’re in the market for one, our colleagues at The Wirecutter have tested quite a few, and they've put together an excellent guide to the best.)","hasPart":{"@type":"WebPageElement","cssSelector":".recipe","isAccessibleForFree":false},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"NYT Cooking","productID":"cooking.nytimes.com:basic"},"name":"Chocolate Chip Cookies","primaryImageOfPage":[{"@id":"nyt://image/221a2f19-e3c7-5ea0-bfcb-67910aba12fe#videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600","@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/12/dining/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/JT-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","creditText":"Ryan Liebe for The New York Times.
