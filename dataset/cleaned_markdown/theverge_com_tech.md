Apple hit with $634 million verdict in patent battle with Masimo.

A federal jury in California sided with medical tech company Masimo in its suit alleging that the [Apple Watch infringed on its patent](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/15/apple-hit-with-634-million-verdict-in-apple-watch-patent-fight-with-masimo/) covering low-power pulse oximeter features. The victory hinged on the definition of the term “patient monitor,” which Apple argued only applied to devices that provided continuous monitoring, while the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen features only kick in after 10 minutes of inactivity. This case is separate from the one [working its way through the ITC](/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute).

Android 17 might add native game controller remapping.

Normally, you’re kind of stuck with the button mapping video game developers choose, based on your controller of choice. But _[Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-gaming-features-rumor-3616027/)_ has found evidence in the latest [Android Canary](https://developer.android.com/about/canary) release that Google is adding native remapping. That’s huge for improving accessibility and support for cloud gaming, where titles aren’t usually built with Android in mind.

Co-founder of an AI transcription company claims it was originally just two guys pretending to be AI.

According to Sam Udotong, one of the founders of Fireflies.ai, when the company first started in 2017:

> We told our customers there’s an “AI that’ll join a meeting.” In reality it was just me and my co-founder calling in to the meeting sitting there silently and taking notes by hand.

While Udotong claims it was clear to these early beta customers that “there was a human in the loop,” it still raises [serious privacy concerns](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/usd1-billion-ai-company-co-founder-admits-that-its-usd100-a-month-transcription-service-was-originally-two-guys-surviving-on-pizza-and-typing-out-notes-by-hand/) and sounds alarmingly close to flat-out fraud.

Steam Frame doesn’t let you see the real world in color because Valve’s considering your wallet.

Valve’s marketing video for Steam Frame [is a bit misleading](https://youtu.be/OmKrKTwtukE?si=F0WidewFD_C_4YWQ&t=250) — its monochrome cameras mean you’d see the world around the screen in shades of grey, not color. But I’m hoping that means affordable. Valve’s Jeremy Selan told us:

> While this is a premium headset, we did want to be cost considerate because we’re really trying to make this accessible to as many people as we can.

The Steam Controller doesn’t have a headphone jack, and Valve told us why — kind of.

“This is both a peripheral controller for a PC as well as the Steam Machine or whatever else you want to plug it into,” said hardware engineer Steve Cardinali. “Most of the time, your audio will be coming from that, not directly your controller.” Because of that, “we just didn’t feel like it was necessary.”

I still wish it was there; I use the DualSense’s headphone jack for quiet audio at night all the time. Otherwise, [I really like the controller](/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine).

Fixing the wrong problem.

Tesla might be about to give in and [adopt Apple’s CarPlay system](/news/820065/tesla-apple-carplay-develop-phone-mirror) in its cars. It’s a welcome change, but somehow I suspect this commenter isn’t the only one holding out on a Model Y purchase for [slightly different reasons.](/news/815892/tesla-shareholder-vote-elon-musk-pay-trillion-robot)

Samsung’s latest SmartThings hub arrives in the US.

Aeotec’s [$119.99 Smart Home Hub 2](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartthings/hub/aeotec-smart-home-hub-2-sku-207025/) features faster hardware, USB expandability, and support for Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, and Thread. It works as a Matter Controller and prioritizes on-hub communications to keep your smart home up when the cloud is down. It doesn’t support Z-Wave.

Steam Frame vs. Meta Quest 3.

I brought our Quest 3 to Valve’s offices _just in case_ we’d be seeing [the Steam Frame](/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on), formerly known [as Deckard](/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak) — and it paid off! I didn’t have time to directly compare optics, but I’d say comfort is superior. It’s noticeably smaller, with controllers that are bigger.
