It’s been a whirlwind of a week for iPhone Air fans. First, _The Information_ [reported](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/10/apple-just-delayed-the-iphone-air-2-indefinitely-report-says/) that Apple had indefinitely delayed the iPhone Air 2 due to lower-than-expected sales.

The next day, [a separate report said](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/11/apple-iphone-air-2-cameras/) the iPhone Air 2 had actually just been delayed six months, with Apple targeting a spring 2027 launch instead of fall 2026.

Now, [_Bloomberg’s_ Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o?srnd=undefined) has more details on what’s going on with the iPhone Air 2.

In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, _[Bloomberg’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o?srnd=undefined)_[ Mark Gurman reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o?srnd=undefined) that Apple has “largely written off the Mac Pro.”

The Mac Pro [was last updated in 2023](https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/05/apple-announces-apple-silicon-mac-pro-powered-by-m2-ultra/) with the M2 Ultra chip, and there are no plans for a new update anytime soon.

A federal jury in California has sided with Masimo in a patent battle with Apple over Apple Watch’s blood oxygen feature. The jury awarded Masimo $634 million in damages and concluded that Apple infringed on a Masimo patent covering low power pulse oximeter features.

As explained by [_Daily Journal_](https://www.dailyjournal.com/articles/388571-masimo-wins-634-million-verdict-against-apple-in-high-stakes-patent-fight-over-apple-watch), much of the case centered on whether Apple Watch can be categorized as a “patient monitor” per Masimo’s patent.

Next year, Apple is [reportedly](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/04/cheaper-macbook-powered-by-iphone-chip-coming-in-2026-per-new-report/) going to debut a new MacBook model beneath the [MacBook Air](https://amzn.to/4pb5S8q). It’ll be the first MacBook to utilize iPhone silicon, and it’ll be the [first MacBook](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/04/cheaper-macbook-powered-by-iphone-chip-coming-in-2026-per-new-report/) that sells far beneath the $999 price point. It sounds like a winning formula – but will it actually be one?

The iPhone’s Portrait mode uses computational photography to simulate the shallow depth of field of a digital SLR or mirrorless camera with a larger sensor. It’s evolved from a very crude tool into something which is now pretty convincing, but it’s still no substitute for the real thing.

There are some circumstances in which you can get genuine shallow-ish depth of field with an iPhone shot, but these are very limited as we’ll discuss. The Sandmarc 2x telephoto lens is a much more practical way to get true optical blurring when shooting portraits …

When[ AirPods Pro 3 ](https://amzn.to/4qhKfVI)initially debuted, I was a little bit hesitant about upgrading. I felt that [AirPods Pro 2](https://amzn.to/43kfdSY) were still excellent. On top of that, one of the key features of [AirPods Pro 3](https://amzn.to/4qhKfVI), Live Translation, was also coming to [AirPods Pro 2](https://amzn.to/43kfdSY). However, now that I’ve actually given them a shot – I can genuinely say I was wrong about my pessimism.

Apple unveiled the new [M5 iPad Pro](https://amzn.to/4oToBFs) last month, kicking off a new iPad lineup. While it didn’t bring any headlining upgrades, it does provide us some clues as to what’s coming next for the iPad lineup. Plus, there are many rumors to follow, which we’ll be diving into.

Managed Apple Accounts are quickly becoming the foundation of Apple devices at work, and if your organization has not rolled them out yet, it’s a project worthy of your team’s attention heading into 2026. Back in my long-retired K-12 tech-focused days in 2012, [Fraser Speirs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraserspeirs/) and I talked at length about how identity management was the problem to solve in a cloud and multi-device world. Apple’s managed identity system has quietly become one of the most important parts of its enterprise story. What started as a way to manage App Store accounts for students and employees has evolved into a secure, scalable identity layer that connects everything in the Apple ecosystem with the tools IT already uses.

[SwitchBot](https://amzn.to/4p1rXXl) continues to expand its smart home lineup, with the newest addition being a great new lighting series that works with Matter over Wi-Fi. That means you can connect lights directly to the HomeKit without needing a hub or bridge (outside of an Apple TV or HomePod). The new lineup from SwitchBot includes new RGBIC lights, a flexible neon rope light, and randomly, even a candle warmer lamp that can sync up with your existing HomeKit scenes and automation. SwitchBot has been a roll in 2025 with several new products that work great with HomeKit. Let’s dive in to what’s new.

Apple is a much larger company now than it was when Steve Jobs passed, and recently it’s been experimenting with diversifying the iPhone lineup to better serve a growing user base. We’re starting to see some growing pains, and more change is coming.

In August, Apple [launched a “redesigned” version](https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/14/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-feature-returning-in-the-u-s-today/) of the Apple Watch’s Blood Oxygen feature in the United States. This came 18 months after [Apple started selling](https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-without-blood-oxygen-sensor/) the Apple Watch without the Blood Oxygen feature in [due to a patent dispute](https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/06/apple-watch-ban-news/) with health technology company Masimo.

The International Trade Commission (ITC) now says that it is holding a new proceeding to decide if this solution should also be banned due to the Masimo patent dispute.
