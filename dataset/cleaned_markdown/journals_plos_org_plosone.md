## [Detecting LLM-generated peer reviews](/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331871)

Rao and Colleagues address the challenge of detecting Large-Language-Model (LLM) generated peer reviews by injecting multiple prompts into the paper's PDF, which they then search for references in the generated review, with high statistical success. This offers a potential solution to the one of the many issues posed by Artificial Intelligence impacting the publishing process.

## [The role of educational attainment and quality in U.S. regional variation in prevalence of dementia and CIND](/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0332410)

Ailshire and colleagues find that state-level education quality fully accounts for the higher prevalence of dementia in the US South. This suggests education explains regional disparities in dementia and cognitive impairment, and educational environment matters more than educational attainment.
