## How to get started in computer science

The outset of your journey to learn computer science can feel daunting, but building a goal-oriented roadmap can help. You can follow these steps to [get started in computer science with no experience](https://www.edx.org/resources/can-i-get-into-computer-science-with-no-experience):

1\. Focus on foundations

Many computer science concepts draw heavily on logic and math. You can build strong foundations for computer science learning by ensuring you have solid knowledge in these areas.

Focus specifically on these areas:

  * Classical rule-based logic systems
  * Boolean logic
  * Algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics, and statistics

You can pursue many avenues for brushing up on your logic and math skills. Free, self-guided tutorials can help, especially if you already have background knowledge. You can also consider [online math courses and programs](https://www.edx.org/learn/math) for a more structured alternative

2\. Consider a computer science boot camp or certificate program

Computer science boot camps are short, beginner-friendly programs that emphasize skills-based fundamentals. While some providers tout them as efficient and inexpensive ways to prepare for entry-level job opportunities, they typically focus on specific hard skills, like [computer coding](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding).

As an alternative, you can also pursue an undergraduate [certificate in computer science](https://www.edx.org/certificates/computer-science-certificates/). These pathways offer a deeper, more complete introduction to computer science. Some of your credits may also transfer toward a degree program, which may reduce both the cost and time you spend completing your education.

3\. Enroll in an undergraduate degree program

An associate degree in computer science may suffice for some junior roles, but a bachelor's degree is generally considered the minimum level of education you need for upward career mobility.

In its [August 2025 review](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/) of the 10 fast-growing computer science careers, the BLS lists a bachelor's degree as the required entry-level education for eight job titles. Bachelor's programs also offer specialization opportunities in computer science subfields, including AI, cybersecurity, data science, [information technology](https://www.edx.org/resources/computer-science-vs-information-technology), and many others.

4\. Learn through practice

You can learn computer science through practice in many contexts. As a student, you can pursue personal projects or participate in coding challenges. As a computer science professional, you can take opportunities to learn new skills by collaborating with peers and taking part in any professional development programs your employer may offer.

The more you practice computer science — and the more technical concepts you expose yourself to — the more your proficiencies will grow. By pursuing continued self-guided development diligently, you can build a diverse and valuable skill set that employers value.

5\. Continue with specialized or advanced education

Some labor market analysts and tech industry insiders have noticed that the computer science landscape is saturated with candidates who have similar credentials. Given the increasingly competitive nature of computer science jobs, differentiating yourself may pay off.

Potentially helpful strategies include:

  * Earning one or more widely recognized [computer science professional certifications](https://www.edx.org/resources/certifications-computer-science).
  * Pursuing a graduate certificate in a specialized branch of computer science.
  * Enrolling in an [advanced computer science degree program](https://www.edx.org/masters/online-masters-in-computer-science).

To learn more, review edX's resource on the [benefits of a master's degree in computer science](https://www.edx.org/resources/is-a-masters-degree-in-computer-science-worth-it).

## How long does it take to learn computer science?

With regular practice and strong effort, you can learn coding and computer science basics in a few months. Complete, career-ready skills take longer to build: Four years is the typical timeline for earning a bachelor's degree.

## Frequently asked questions

Can I learn computer science on my own?

Yes, you can learn computer science through self-directed study by taking advantage of free or low-cost instructional resources, like video lectures and tutorials. Some employers prioritize hard, demonstrable skills over formal educational credentials, but you should consider validating the skills you gain by earning a professional certificate before entering the job market.

Is computer science full of math?

Computer science draws extensively on mathematics, but to describe it as "full of math" overlooks some key considerations. Many areas of computer science engage algebra, calculus, discrete math, and statistics, but the extent to which you will use these mathematical branches in your studies or job duties varies by specialization and role.

Schools and programs also use various strategies to teach computer science, and some approaches involve less math than others.

Will computer science be replaced by AI?

Artificial intelligence appears positioned to automate some entry-level computer science roles, particularly in areas like coding and basic programming. However, fears that AI systems will completely replace human computer science professionals do not align with the expert consensus.

Instead, AI will change the way computer scientists perform their research and job duties, rather than eliminating human roles.

Is a computer science degree worth it?

A computer science degree can help you qualify for high-paying, high-growth career opportunities. These programs also teach versatile and valuable technical skills that transfer well among many industries. From this perspective, a computer science degree often offers a strong return on investment.
