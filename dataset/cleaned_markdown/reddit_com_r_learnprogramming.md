[ Don't make the same mistakes I did learning programming  ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oyrne8/dont_make_the_same_mistakes_i_did_learning/)

[ u/AbyssBite ](/user/AbyssBite/)

• [ Don't make the same mistakes I did learning programming  ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oyrne8/dont_make_the_same_mistakes_i_did_learning/) [ I spent the first year of learning programming doing a bunch of things wrong, and I want to save anyone else the headache.  **1\. Don 't start with Python.** Yeah, everyone says "Python is easy" and "best for beginners". The truth is, it's way too forgiving. I got used to writing code that worked without understanding what was actually happening under the hood. Then I jumped into Rust later and realized I basically had to relearn everything; memory, types, how the computer actually handles your code. If I could go back, I'd start with something a bit more challenging that actually teaches you the fundamentals.  **2\. Don 't rely on AI chatbots.** I spent months having chatbots "help" me write code. Sure, it works, but I didn't actually learn anything. Struggle a bit, break things, debug it yourself. That's how real understanding happens.  **3\. Stop just following tutorials.** I wasted months cloning tutorials, thinking I was learning. Most of it didn't stick. The moment I started building tiny projects I actually cared about, things finally clicked. Even a dumb little project that scratches your own itch will teach you more than ten tutorials ever will.  **4\. Learn the tools, not just the language.** Knowing syntax isn't enough. Debugging, testing, version control, libraries, deployment... all that boring stuff actually matters. I ignored this at first, and it hurt me later when I tried to build real things.  **5\. Embrace being stuck.** If you're never confused, frustrated, or banging your head against a wall, you're not really learning. Those are the moments when growth actually happens.  ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oyrne8/dont_make_the_same_mistakes_i_did_learning/)

[ 20+ years in tech, and here's the one thing I'd tell every new programmer  ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1osvg1m/20_years_in_tech_and_heres_the_one_thing_id_tell/)

[ u/FluxParadigm01 ](/user/FluxParadigm01/)

• [ 20+ years in tech, and here's the one thing I'd tell every new programmer ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1osvg1m/20_years_in_tech_and_heres_the_one_thing_id_tell/) [ I've written production code in everything from C to Rust to Python to TypeScript across startups, enterprise, government, and AI labs. Over the years, one truth keeps proving itself:  **Programming isn 't about code. It's about clarity.** Early in my career, I thought skill meant knowing everything: frameworks, syntax quirks, cloud configs, you name it. But the developers who actually made things happen weren't the ones who typed fast or memorized docs. They were the ones who could think clearly about problems.  When you learn to: 

  * Define the problem before touching the keyboard 
  * Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple 
  * Name things precisely 
  * Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms 

...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust.  If you're early in your journey, here's my best advice: 

  * Don't chase tools, chase understanding. 
  * Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it. 
  * Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist. 

Everything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally.  _What 's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?_ ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1osvg1m/20_years_in_tech_and_heres_the_one_thing_id_tell/)

Im looking for a course that covers the fundamentals well and also gives me practical projects so I can build a strong portfolio. Ideally, it should be beginner friendly but still offer depth as I improve.I tried a few free tutorials online, but they feel too fragmented and I end up losing track of what to focus on.  ](/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oz1x3q/best_online_coding_course/)

[ New? READ ME FIRST! ](https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/61oly8/new_read_me_first/) [ Posting guidelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index) [ FAQ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq)

* * *

## 

r/learnprogramming Rules

* 1

##  No unprofessional/derogatory speech 

Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette): behave professionally and civilly at all times. Communicate to others the same way you would at your workplace. Disagreement and technical critiques are ok, but personal attacks are not. 

Abusive, racist, or derogatory comments are absolutely not tolerated. 

See our [policies on acceptable speech and conduct](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_acceptable_speech_and_conduct) for more details. 

Violations cause instant ban. 

* 2

##  No spam or tasteless self-promotion 

When posting some resource or tutorial you've made, you must follow our [self-promotion policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_self-promotion). 

In short, your posting history should not be predominantly self-promotional and your resource should be high-quality and complete. Your post should not "feel spammy". 

Self promotion from first time posters without prior participation in the subreddit is explicitly forbidden. 

When in doubt, message the mods and ask them to review your post. 

* 3

##  No off-topic posts 

Do not post questions that are completely unrelated to programming, software engineering, and related fields. Tech support and hardware recommendation questions count as "completely unrelated". 

Questions that straddle the line between learning programming and learning other tech topics are ok: we don't expect beginners to know how exactly to categorize their question. 

See our [policies on allowed topics](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_allowed_topics) for more details. 

* 4

##  Do not ask exact duplicates of FAQ questions 

Do not post questions that are an exact duplicate of something already answered in the [FAQ](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq). 

If your question is similar to an existing FAQ question, you MUST cite which part of the FAQ you looked at and what exactly you want clarification on. 

* 5

##  Do not delete posts 

Do not delete your post! Your problem may be solved, but others who have similar problems in the future could benefit from the solution/discussion in the thread. 

Use the "solved" flair instead. 

* 6

##  No app/website review requests/app showcases 

Do not request reviews for, promote, or showcase some app or website you've written. This is a subreddit for learning programming, not a "critique my project" or "advertise my project" subreddit. 

Asking for code reviews is ok as long as you [follow the relevant policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_for_a_code_review). In short, link to only your code and be specific about what you want feedback on. Do not include a link to a final product or to a demo in your post. 

* 7

##  No rewards 

You may not ask for or offer payment of any kind (monetary or otherwise) when giving or receiving help. 

In particular, it is not appropriate to offer a reward, bounty, or bribe to try and expedite answers to your question, nor is it appropriate to offer to pay somebody to do your work or homework for you. 

* 8

##  No indirect links 

All links must link directly to the destination page. Do not use URL shorteners, referral links or click-trackers. Do not link to some intermediary page that contains mostly only a link to the actual page and no additional value. 

For example, linking to some tweet or some half-hearted blog post which links to the page is not ok; but linking to a tweet with interesting replies or to a blog post that does some extra analysis is. 

Udemy coupon links are ok: the discount adds "additional value". 

* 9

##  Do not promote illegal or unethical practices 

Do not ask for help doing anything illegal or unethical. Do not suggest or help somebody do something illegal or unethical. 

This includes piracy: asking for or posting links to pirated material is strictly forbidden and can result in an instant and permanent ban. 

Trying to circumvent the 
* 10

##  No complete solutions 

**Do not** ask for or post a complete solution to a problem. 

When working on a problem, try solving it on your own first and ask for help on _specific_ parts you're stuck with. 

If you're helping someone, focus on helping OP make _forward progress_ : link to docs, unblock misconceptions, give examples, teach general techniques, ask leading questions, give hints, but no direct solutions. 

See our [guidelines on offering help](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_offering_help) for more details. 

* 11

##  Don't Ask To Ask 

**Don 't ask to ask.**

Ask your questions right here in the open subreddit. Show what you have tried and tell us exactly where you got stuck. 

We want to keep all discussion inside the open subreddit so that more people can chime in and help as well as benefit from the help given. 

* 12

##  Low Effort Questions 

Do not ask easily googleable questions or questions that are covered in the documentation. 

This subreddit is not a proxy for documentation or google. 

We do require effort and demonstration of effort. 

This includes "how do I?" questions 

* 13

##  AI generated 

No AI (chatGPT etc.) generated messages/comments. No questions about chatGPT/AI generated code. No VIBE CODING! 

Such posts/comments will be removed without warning and the poster of ai generated content will be instantly banned.
