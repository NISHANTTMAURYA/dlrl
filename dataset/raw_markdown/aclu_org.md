## Freedom To Be

Freedom To Be 

Over the past several years, politicians across the country have banned health care access for transgender youth and their families put themselves between trans people, their families, and their health care providers on how they can live their authentic lives.

Consistent with our 105-year history of defending the right of self-expression and self-determination, the ACLU is committed to the freedom of transgender people and their families. We have fought laws that censor LGBTQ people, ban gender-affirming medical care, make schools less safe for trans students, and force trans people to carry documents outing them as trans.

Our [Freedom to Be](https://www.aclu.org/campaigns-initiatives/freedom-to-be) campaign and programming also serves to celebrate trans individuals around the country who are building solidarity within their communities and finding joy and happiness among their families and friends. Through their powerful and poignant storytelling, as well as our landmark Freedom to Be Monument, which showcases artwork and messaging by over 1,000 trans people and allies across the United States, we are uplifting the dynamic and diverse trans voices around our nation.
