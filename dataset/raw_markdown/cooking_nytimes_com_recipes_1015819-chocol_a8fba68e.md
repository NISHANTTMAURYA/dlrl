You may have memorized the foolproof gem on the back of the Toll House bag, given to the world by Ruth Graves Wakefield in the 1930s. But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. (You can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work. If you’re in the market for one, our colleagues at The Wirecutter have tested quite a few, and they've put together [an excellent guide to the best](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-stand-mixer/).) —David Leite

## Preparation

Make the recipe with usWatch

  1. Step 1

Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.

  2. Step 2

Using a [mixer](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-stand-mixer/) fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.

  3. Step 3

When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.

  4. Step 4

Scoop 6 3½-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.




Tip

  * Disks are sold at Jacques Torres Chocolate; Valrhona fèves, oval-shaped chocolate pieces, are at Whole Foods.

I think this recipe is unnecessarily fussy. The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine.

I learned a trick from Cooks Illustrsted that I have used for several recipes, including CC cookies. Use cold butter. Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully!

This is our family's favourite cookie. Just can't be beat and we add a scoop of caramel sea salt ice cream to make it even better.

I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated the dough for 24 hours. They turned out great! I made each cookie 2.3 ounces but the dough only made about 30 cookies. I'll make these again!

This is an amazing recipe, but as others have suggested, needlessly overcomplicated and overworked. I made as written the first time. Subsequent times I've used plain all purpose flour and didn't bother with the long refrigeration time for the first batch. Tastes exactly the same. Save yourself the hassle! Works great to mold into rows for slice and bake cookies. Makes about 3 18 inch logs and great to keep in fridge for instant cookies.
