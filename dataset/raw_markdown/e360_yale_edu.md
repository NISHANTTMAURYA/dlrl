  * ### [Growth of Wind and Solar Keeping Fossil Power in Check](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/wind-solar-power-2025)

This year, new wind and solar power will more than meet growing demand for electricity globally, keeping fossil fuel consumption flat, analysts project. [More about Growth of Wind and Solar Keeping Fossil Power in Check →](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/wind-solar-power-2025)

  * ### [Climate Plans Focus More on Planting Trees Than on Protecting Forests, Experts Warn](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/climate-plans-forests-tree-planting)

The climate plans that countries have submitted to the U.N. will do too little to protect the world's forests and their vast stores of carbon, experts say.

The International Energy Agency, the world's chief forecaster of future energy use, continues to project that global demand for fossil fuels will peak before the end of this decade, if countries push forward on their climate goals. However, it sees rising power demand from data centers and air conditioners buoying the use of fossil power.
