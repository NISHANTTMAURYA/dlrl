##  How to Make Lasagna 

Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are _well_ worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics: 

###  Lasagna Ingredients 

The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list: 

  * **Meat** : This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage _and_ lean ground beef.
  * **Onion and garlic** : An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
  * **Tomato products** : You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
  * **Sugar** : Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
  * **Spices and seasonings** : This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
  * **Lasagna noodles** : Use store-bought or [homemade lasagna noodles](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266023/homemade-lasagna-sheets/).
  * **Cheeses** : Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
  * **Egg** : An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.



###  How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step 

Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna: 

  1. Make the meat sauce.
  2. Cook the noodles.
  3. Make the ricotta mixture.
  4. Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.
  5. Cover with foil and bake.
  6. Let the lasagna rest before serving.



###  How to Layer Lasagna 

The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow: 

  1. Meat sauce
  2. Noodles
  3. Ricotta mixture
  4. Mozzarella slices
  5. Meat sauce
  6. Parmesan cheese
  7. Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.



###  How Long to Cook Lasagna 

The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.

##  How to Reheat Lasagna 

You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly. 

##  How to Freeze Lasagna 

If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months. 

###  How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna 

Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through. 

##  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise 

"We live in St. Louis where we have fabulous Italian food," says [meyerrachelle](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/3804456). "This lasagna could've come from any of the well-known restaurants in our area. My family was raving about it! The sauce is absolutely amazing! This is definitely a keeper! It lives up to its name." 

"The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a while but it is so worth it. Team it with [garlic bread](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21060/toasted-garlic-bread/) and a salad and you'll be very satisfied." 

"Absolutely phenomenal," raves [Amanda Simopoulos](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/16014652). "Fair warning: once you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be impossible. It is somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells delectable every time I make it!

  6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 

  7. To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

  8. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

A keeper! Easy to follow Worth the effort Crowd-pleaser Family favorite

One of our favorite all time recipes. It does take time, but worth the effort. We swap out beef for pork Italian sausage, used 1 less tomato paste, and no fennel seeds due to allergies and it is perfect! There was about 1 cup of the meat sauce left over which we used on thin spaghetti. 100% best lasagna recipe out there.

Needs more flavor

Not too dry, not too wet; consistency is just right. This is a great recipe, and I followed it closely (except used shredded instead of slices). I personally enjoy bold flavours, so if I make it again I’ll likely bump up a few ingredients (not the sugar). It’s a perfect crowd-pleaser, one that’s solid and balanced, and no one at the table could find anything to complain about.

I made this for a family reunion and they absolutely loved it! I did double the ricotta and used 2 lbs of meat and 1 lb of sausage meat. I did 3 noodle layers instead of the suggested 2 layers. I boiled the noodles in a 9 x 13 glass dish to prevent the noodles from sticking. I boiled the water with olive oil. Then I laid the noodles in the pan. I added the boiling water to the pan and used a spatula to separate the noodles. I waited 30 minutes and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I did check on the noodles to make sure they weren't sticking to each other during that time. Everything came out great and was super delicious and flavorful! I can't wait to make it again! I would suggest to have some leftover sauce without the meat to coat the bottom of the pan and for the top layer. For the top layer it was just noodles and cheese (I usually place sauce on top of the noodles followed by cheese). It still was very good without the sauce on top, but maybe I will add the sauce the next time I make it. The sauce was not watery! I also didn't drain the fat from the meat because the directions never mentioned to do that, but I wonder if I should drain some of the fat next time as I thought the sauce was oily while it was simmering.

Worth the effort A keeper!

This is an excellent recipe to use as a base and then make it your own. I cook 16 noodles and make it a four layer. I use the ingredients listed and it is enough for all four layers. I have a 3-1/2" lasagna pan that makes this possible. The sauce by it's self is terrific for spaghetti too. My Italian friends even give it two thumbs up! Buon appetito!
