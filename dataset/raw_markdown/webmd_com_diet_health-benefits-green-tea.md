## What Is Green Tea?

It's a beverage or dietary supplement that may improve your mental alertness, ease your digestive symptoms and headaches, and help you with weight loss.

![](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/Life_with_j_pouch_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_green_tea.jpg?resize=750px:*&output-quality=75)

Green tea may have benefits for your health. (Photo Credit: kuppa_rock / Getty Images) 

Itâs been a popular drink as well as a traditional medicine in China and Japan for thousands of years. Early in the 17th century, it was introduced to consumers in Europe who instantly welcomed the beverage. In 18th century England, green tea was so valuable and popular that it was often smuggled in to avoid taxes.

These days, thereâs no need to resort to smuggling. Green tea is widely available across the globe. Dozens of brands of bagged green tea can be found on store shelves, blended from a variety of green tea. There are flavored and sweetened varieties, as well as green tea powder and loose leaf tea. Whatever way you want to drink green tea, thereâs probably a product already on the market.

Green tea is often consumed for reasons other than its possible health benefits. But thereâs actually quite a lot happening in a cup of green tea, and itâs worth getting to the bottom of.

## Green Tea NutritionÂ 

While there are many compounds, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals in green tea leaves, those elements are extremely diluted in a single cup of tea. Once steeped, the resulting green tea beverage is almost entirely water.

There are less than 3 calories in 8 fluid ounces of green tea and no measurable amounts of protein, fat, [carbohydrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-carbs), fiber, or sugar.

Vitamins and minerals found in green tea are also minimal. A few that can be found in small quantities include:

  * Calcium
  * Iron
  * Potassium



Green tea does pack a potent punch of polyphenols, a type of [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-antioxidants).

âGreen tea contains polyphenols, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), that may play a role in protecting against cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and has also been associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline,â says Rachelle LaCroix Mallik, RD, LDN, a Chicago based dietitian.

### **Does green tea have caffeine?**

Yes.****As a caffeine-rich drink, it may pose a risk to people with[diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20080128/caffeine-risks-may-rattle-diabetics). Caffeine has been shown to potentially raise blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. As for the amounts, 8 fluid ounces of green tea has about 28 milligrams of caffeine. Thatâs compared with 47 milligrams of caffeine for the same amount of black tea and 96 milligrams of caffeine for the same amount of coffee.

### **Green tea vs. black tea**

Green and black tea come from the same plant,Â  _Camellia sinensis_. The difference is how the leaves are handled after harvest.

Green tea leaves are heated and dried right away. This stops them from fermenting, so they stay lighter in color and taste.

Black tea leaves are left to ferment, which means they sit in the air and react with oxygen. This natural change makes them darker and gives the tea a stronger flavor.

Both teas have antioxidants and caffeine but in different forms.

âGreen and black teas are both âtrue teas,â unlike herbal teas, and naturally contain caffeine,â Mallik says. âBrewed green tea typically has less caffeine than black, with the exception of matcha, which is made from ground whole tea leaves and is more concentrated.â

## Green Tea Benefits

Many health benefit claims have been made about green tea for centuries. Traditionally, in China and India, green tea was a medicine for controlling bleeding, aiding [digestion](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/your-digestive-system), and regulating body temperature. In modern times, research has been able to show some of its health benefits more solidly than others.

### **Heart health**

One large study in Japan followed 40,000 adult participants over 11 years and showed that daily consumption of green tea was linked to a low risk of death from [cardiovascular diseases](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/diseases-cardiovascular). In particular, the study examined the link between polyphenols (antioxidants) in green tea and cardiovascular diseases. The minimum daily consumption needed to see this benefit was five cups per day.

### **Diabetes**

Green tea can help regulate your blood sugar levels. It lowers your fasting blood sugar and [HbA1c](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glycated-hemoglobin-test-hba1c) when you have type 2 diabetes.

### **Stroke prevention**

Another large Japanese study, this one following more than 82,000 participants over 13 years, showed that higher consumption rates of green tea were associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Participants who drank four cups or more per day saw the highest benefit.

### **Genital wart treatment**

The FDA has approved a topical green tea extract treatment to treat breakouts of genital warts. This ointment is available by prescription only, and it is estimated to be effective for 24%-60% of patients.

### **Benefits for your skin**

Studies show green tea may have [anti-inflammatory](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/anti-inflammatory) and anticancer benefits that may help you have healthier skin. Their findings suggest skin products with green tea in them may be good for you. But more research is needed.

### **Green tea and ginger**

Both green tea and ginger have been shown to have health benefits when ingested on their own. Throughout history, green tea has been thought to aid in digestion, regulate body temperature, and control bleeding. For centuries, ginger has been used to treat digestive problems, arthritis, [asthma](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/what-is-asthma), diabetes, and menstrual symptoms. Scientific studies support its ability to ease nausea and vomiting linked to pregnancy, surgery, cancer therapy, and motion sickness. Ginger is also proven to lower inflammation and pain. So, itâs not surprising to think that ginger and green tea would have health benefits when had together.

### **Weight loss**

Some studies show that green tea and ginger may help with weight loss. In one study, weight loss capsules containing green tea, [ginger](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/ginger-uses-and-risks), and capsaicin (the spicy component of chili peppers) were much more effective in promoting weight loss than a placebo.

But more research is needed to know how much the capsaicin contributed to those results.

## Green Tea Benefits for Women

Some studies suggest higher green tea intake can lower the odds of getting breast cancer or having a recurrence. But more research is needed to understand the link.

Mallik notes a Japanese study where women with early-stage breast cancer who drank three to five cups daily before diagnosis had a 44% lower risk of their cancer coming back compared to non-tea drinkers.

Green tea with or without ginger is sometimes used to ease painful periods. It may also help with conditions such as [endometriosis](https://www.webmd.com/women/endometriosis/endometriosis-causes-symptoms-treatment), fibroids, and polycystic ovarian syndrome ([PCOS](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-pcos)), though the science is limited.

## Green Tea Benefits for Men

Some research points to a lower risk of prostate cancer in men who drink more green tea, but results have been mixed.

Thereâs some evidence that drinking green tea over time may help with healthy aging. Studies suggest it could ease inflammation linked to depression, support weight control, and improve testosterone levels in middle-aged and older men.

Green tea has also been tied to lower risk of cognitive decline. One study on older Japanese adults found that men and women who drank three or more glasses a day were less likely to develop dementia. More research is still needed to learn if thereâs a causal link.

## Green Tea Side Effects

There isn't much evidence that drinking green tea and ginger could be harmful. But too much ginger can cause [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/cm/diarrhea-causes), heartburn, and even an irregular heartbeat. While it would be pretty hard to overdose on ginger by drinking ginger and green tea, itâs much easier to do so by taking diet pills that promote their green tea and ginger content.

Always check with your doctor before taking supplements, and follow dosing instructions carefully. Drinking eight cups per day or less of green tea is considered safe for most adults. But there are risks posed by drinking green tea in high concentrations, especially as an extract.

[In](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/features/healthy-liver) rare cases, green tea extract may cause liver problems. While the research is limited, you should avoid green tea extract if you have liver problems.

Stop taking green tea extract and contact your doctor if you have [abdominal pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments), dark urine, or jaundice.

### What is the daily amount of green tea that is considered safe?

Thereâs no max limit. But most research suggests three to five cups per day is safe for healthy adults and may offer the greatest benefits. And if youâre sensitive to caffeine, you may not want to drink that much.Â 

âFor folks who cannot tolerate larger amounts of green tea, even just one or more cups per day has been linked with a lower overall cancer risk compared to less than one cup per day,â Mallik says.

Supplements and extracts can deliver much higher doses and may come with more risks and side effects, so always check with your doctor before using them.

## How to Make Green Tea

Use these ingredients to make green tea:

  * 3 cups filtered water
  * 4 green tea bags
  * 1 tablespoon ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
  * 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 4 slices for garnish
  * 2 tablespoons honey



Then follow these directions:

  1. Bring water to just below boiling point. Remove from heat.
  2. Place tea bags in a pitcher, and add ginger slices. Pour hot water over the tea bags. Let them steep for 8-10 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Stir in lemon juice and [honey](https://www.webmd.com/diet/honey-health-benefits).
  3. Serve warm or iced.



Thereâs no evidence that, health-wise, it matters when you drink green tea. Thatâs a matter of your personal preference.

## Takeaways

Green tea is low in calories and rich in plant compounds called antioxidants. Drinking a few cups a day may support heart, brain, and blood sugar health. It has less caffeine than coffee or black tea.

Most people can drink green tea safely, but high-dose extracts may cause problems.

Think of green tea as a healthy choice, but not a cure-all.

## Green Tea FAQs

### What diseases does green tea fight?

Studies suggest green may help with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Most of this evidence is stronger in lab and animal studies. More research in people is still needed.

### What cannot be taken with green tea?

Green tea, whether caffeinated or decaf, can reduce iron absorption. So, itâs best to take iron supplements separately. Green tea may interact with some medications, including those used to treat high blood pressure, heart problems, and osteoporosis. Ask your doctor whatâs safe.

### Is it good to drink green tea on an empty stomach?

Yes, itâs fine for most people. But thereâs no proof youâll get more health benefits this way. If you have low iron, your doctor may suggest you drink green tea between meals instead of with food.
